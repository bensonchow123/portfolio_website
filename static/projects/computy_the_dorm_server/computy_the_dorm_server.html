    <p>This is my NAS(network attached storage), media streaming server and general server, I set up in my first-year dorm at the University of York, which does not break any university rules.</p>
    <p class="lb">What is the justification for setting this up?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I had over 300GB of media files stored on my 1TB NVME SSD on my laptop before this
        </li>
        <li>
            I could not access the 300GB of media files on my other devices.
        </li>
        <li>
            My laptop and music library were not backed up.
        </li>
        <li>
            I needed a computer that runs 24/7 to execute scripts, instead of running scripts on the cloud.
        </li>
        <li>
            Having a NAS is very convenient for day-to-day life—for example, it lets you work on the same files from different devices and transfer files between them
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lb">This project can be split into two main parts</p>
    <ul>
        <li>

    <p class="lb">Server Hardware</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Hardware (closeup in image 2 & 3):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Used PI5 from Ebay with a fan included for £55</li>
                <li>27W USB-C power supply for £11</li>
                <li>Waveshare PCIE to M.2 Hat from Aliexpress for £1 (using the welcome coupon)</li>
                <li>256GB Patriot P300 gen 3 NVME SSD for £16</li>
                <li>Used 2TB seagate barracuda HDD with 10k power on hours for £20</li>
                <li>Barely used 960GB MSI S270 SSD for £30</li>
                <li>USB 3.0 duo bay SATA caddy for £20</li>
                <li>USB 3.0 to SATA cable I already got</li>
                <li>Ethernet cable I aready got</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Hardware usage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The PI is used as the server, powered by the 27W power supply.</li>
                <li>There is one singular lane of Gen 3 PCIE exposed on the PI, by using the HAT, I can add an M.2 slot onto the PI.</li>
                <li>The 256GB NVME SSD will be my boot drive for the Raspbian OS</li>
                <li>The 2TB HDD will be my backup drive.</li>
                <li>The 960GB SSD will be where media is stored, a SSD is used despite high price is cause I sleep in the same room, HDD is too noisy.</li>
                <li>The caddy is for housing the 2TB HDD, the 2 bays are for future proving, in case I need to spare a USB 3.0 slot.</li>
                <li>The USB 3.0 to SATA cable is for the 960GB SSD.</li>
                <li>The Ethernet cable lets me connect to the University network through the RJ45 ports in my dorm.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lb">3D printed parts</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The parts (Seen in image 2):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Case for the PI5.</li>
                <li>Case for the 960GB SSD, with a no screw locking system.</li>
                <li>Anti vibration TPU feets.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>How did I create them?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All the parts are printed with my dorm room 3D printing setup, it is also in my projects page.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>For the PI5 case (3D render in image 4):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Customized a generic Pi 5 case in Fusion 360 with letter indentations on the outer wall and a notch in the inner wall to fit the HAT.</li>
                        <li>Printed the case in PETG to prevent thermal warping.</li>
                        <li>Printed the letters in PLA and superglued them into the indentations for perfect alignment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For the SSD case (3D render in image 5):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I took a 2.5 inch SSD case with a very clever screwless locking system, and again with Fusion360 added letter indentations.</li>
                        <li>I added indentations for the anti-vibration feets, positioned to match the spacing of the four main screw holes on the Pi 5.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For the anti vibration feets (3D render in image 6):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They are very much needed, as I sleep in the same room as the server.</li>
                        <li>To maximize dampening, the feets have a single-wall structure with a wave-like infill pattern.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lb">Network Configurations</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>What I have done:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conenct server to the University network.</li>
                <li>Creating a VPN between my devices.</li>
                <li>Setting up a firewall.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Connecting server to the University network:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I followed <a class="outgoing-links" href="https://support.york.ac.uk/s/article/Wired-Connecting-RaspberryPiOS" target="_blank">this useful guide from the IT department, you can adjust this according to your network manager.</a>.</li>
                <li>For Ubuntu based Linux distributions, <a class="outgoing-links" href="https://support.york.ac.uk/s/article/Wired-network-Connecting-Linux" target="_blank">follow this guide</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Creating a VPN between my devices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This ensures security and being able to access the server outside of the University network.</li>
                <li>As the server is connected to the University network, anyone can attempt to access it if services like SSH or web servers are exposed and not properly secured.</li>
                <li>This will allow us to block all inbound traffic to the server except via the VPN.</li>
                <li>Tailscale is the simplest solution to create a mesh VPN.</li>
                <li>I simply downloaded Tailscale on all my devices and configured them to be in the same Tailnet.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Setting up a firewall</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The firewall's main purpose is to block all inbound traffic.</li>
                <li>This is simple with the Linux kernal bundled UFW firewall (uncomplicated firewall).</li>
                <li>I simply setted up a rule to block all inbound traffic.</li>
                <li>Tailscale by defult bypasses UFW, so you can send inbound traffic to the server as long as they are within the same Tailnet.</li>
                <li>After this is setted up, you can run a SSH server on the server safely and do not need to be physically connected to the server to work on it.</li>
            </ul>

    </ul>
    <p class="lb">Media steaming server</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>What I have done:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Organising my music library with Beets.</li>
                <li>Setting up Jellyfin media steaming server.</li>
                <li>Setting up Jellyfin clients on my devices.</li>
                <li>Creating scripts to manage my music library.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Organising my music library with Beets (see my organised music library in image 7)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>My music library was a mess, a single folder containing 100s of FLAC files in random album folders.</li>
                <li>The embedded metadata tags on the FLAC files are also horrible, this is bad news as Jellyfin cataloges music files with metadata tags. </li>
                <li>Beets is a python commandline tool that I uses to ensure a consistent file structure, fetch lyrics, art and other metadata from the internet, and remove duplicated files.</li>
                <li>
                    I organised my library in the following structure:<br>
                    <code>
                        /library<br>
                        //artist1<br>
                        ///album1<br>
                        ////album_cover.jpg<br>
                        ////track1.flac<br>
                        ////track2.flac<br>
                        ...<br>
                        //artist2<br>
                        ...
                    </code>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Setting up Jellyfin media steaming server (see the setted up web GUI on image 8)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jellyfin is a free, open-source media steaming server software.</li>
                <li>I will use it to steam my music library and movies to my other devices.</li>
                <li>I simply downloaded the Jellyfin server software and followed <a class="outgoing-links" href=https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/linux/#debuntu-debian-ubuntu-and-derivatives-using-apt" target="_blank">this guide</a> to install it.</li>
                <li>With that I have a media server running on port 8096 on my server, where all devices on my Tailnet can accesss with `myserver-tailnet-ip:8096` with a browser</li>
                <li>For extra security, I used the `tailscale serve` feature on port 8096, so all steaming connections are encrypted by HTTPS.</li>
                <li>Configurations are done on the webserver itself, after following the setup wizard and configuring some annoying EXT4 file permissions, I now have a media steaming server running in my dorm!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Setting up Jellyfin clients on my devices</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I can access my media streaming server by using a web browser, but the web client lacks features.</li>
                <li>So downloaded a Jellyfin client called Finamp, which is also a free, open source software that is built for Jellyfin on my mobile devices.</li>
                <li>Finamp lets me download music in any format (MP3, AAC, etc.) for offline listening, supports background playback, and offers more features on my mobile devices.</li>
                <li>For my laptop, I will not be using Jellyfin to access the music files.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Creating scripts to manage my music library</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click the `find on github` button above to see those scripts.</li>
                <li>The scripts include a script that syncs my M3U music playlists to my Spotify account</li>
                <li>Also one that splits my playlist into 100-song chunks, so I can sync them to my downloads automaticly in Finamp, without using too much storage.</li>
                <li>The last one I will mention is a script that turns my M3U playlists to Windows file format, so I can use them on my windows partition on my laptop.</li>
                <li>All of the scripts are running via cron jobs automaticly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lb">NAS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A network attached storage is as the name said, stroage attached to a network, in this case the network is my Tailnet.</li>
        <li>I used Sambas, the free and open source software that allows file shareing between Linux/Unix systems and windows.</li>
        <li>The university uses the same software to allow each student to have their 5GB of free storage.</li>
        <li>Editing the Sambas config file, I shared my 960GB SSD to my tailnet.</li>
        <li>I then mount the Sambas share as a network drive on all my devices.</li>
        <li><p>Accessing music library on my laptop:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jellyfin is useful for steaming media, but it doesn't allow you to copy, edit, or manipulate the media files.</li>
                <li>It also doesn't allow for advanced playback features, like DSP support and have limited audio focused plugins.</li>
                <li>Therefore, I uses a audio player called Foobar2000 and its Linux equivelance, the DeaDBeeF player on my laptop (I duoboot both Linux and Windows on my laptop).</li>
                <li>The music player will access the files through the network share as if the files are on my local storage.</li>
                <li>The setted up Foobar2k music player on my Windows partition can be seen in image 9</li>
                <li>The setted up DeaDBeeF music player on my Linux partition can be seen in image 10</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lb">Backups</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Borg is another free and open-source software I used in my server.</li>
        <li>It provides fast, secure and space-efficent backups, through deduplication, compression and encryption.</li>
        <li>The 960GB SSD on the server backups to the 2TB HDD everyday on 5am via a cron job.</li>
        <li>For my Linux partition on my laptop, a startup script backups my laptop to the 2TB HDD via SSH if I haven't done so that day.</li>
        <li>The 2TB HDD itself then backup to the cloud with SSH via another cronjob to achieve 3-2-1 backup.</li>
    </ul>
