    <p>This is my a level computer science project, the problem it solves is the fact that mapping platforms didn't map my school, due to it being a private property.</p>
    <p class="lb">This project has three main features</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Interactive map</li>
        <li>Shortest path calculation between points</li>
        <li>Events report system</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lb">Interactive map</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            First using a satellite image of a school, with the JavaScript library leaflet.js, an image map is initiated.
        </li>
        <li>
            The satellite image is then drawn onto, to highlight paths, parking spaces, shortcuts, stairs and entrances.
        </li>
        <li>
            Leaflet popup are then made for each entrance and intersection, with a special code associated with each popup.
        </li>
        <li>
            It will allow the user to click on the popup, and use the special code to preform shortest path calculation between two points.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lb">Shortest path calculation between points</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Using a bootstrap offcanvas sidebar, the user can enter the special code of the entrance or intersection, and the shortest path to the destination will be calculated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Parameters can be used to filter out certain paths, e.g. stairs.
        </li>
        <li>
            The shortest path algorithm used is Dijkstra's algorithm.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lb">Events report system</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Using mongodb, a database to hold events and staff member accounts are made.
        </li>
        <li>
            A web cookie system allows staff members to login and report events, e.g. Someone crashing a school bus into a gate
        </li>
        <li>
            Admins can demote and promote staff members.
        </li>
        <li>
            A caching system is implemented for the events, so the events are available for the users to view without the need to query the database.
        </li>
    </ul>
